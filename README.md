# Project walk-through

## Uploaded several datasets and a visualization image:

-Costco Global Membership revenue dataset.csv
-statistic_id952763_costco_-paid-membership-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx
-statistic_id718406_costco_-memberships-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx
-Costco-2022-Annual-Report.csv
-lafayette_parish_population_visualizations.png
-lafayette_parish_population_2023.csv

**Let's start by examining each dataset to understand what information is available. Then we can decide on the best way to proceed with building a predictive model.**

import pandas as pd

# Initialize the list to hold the dataset names and previews
dataset_previews = {}

# Read the first few rows of each dataset to understand its structure
dataset_files = [
    "Costco Global Membership revenue dataset.csv",
    "statistic_id952763_costco_-paid-membership-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx",
    "statistic_id718406_costco_-memberships-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx",

#  Here's a brief overview:

- Costco Global Membership revenue dataset.csv: This dataset seems to contain textual descriptions related to Costco, such as the number of memberships, global revenue, and average sales per warehouse. It doesn't appear 
  to contain numerical data for analysis.

- statistic_id952763_costco_-paid-membership-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx: The first few rows of this Excel file don't seem to contain actual data; they may be metadata or introductory content.

- statistic_id718406_costco_-memberships-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx: Similar to the previous Excel file, the first few rows don't seem to contain the actual data.

- Costco-2022-Annual-Report.csv: This file also seems to contain textual data, possibly an introduction or metadata related to Costco's annual report for 2022.

- lafayette_parish_population_2023.csv: This dataset contains population data for areas in Lafayette Parish for the year 2023.

## Before proceeding, I'll check if the Excel files contain more sheets with data. I'll also skip the initial rows in the Excel files to see if they contain any relevant numerical data for analysis.

# Function to read Excel sheets and skip initial rows to find data
def read_excel_sheets(file_path):
    sheet_data = {}
    xl = pd.ExcelFile(file_path)
    sheet_names = xl.sheet_names
    for sheet in sheet_names:
        # Try skipping the initial 5 rows to see if data exists
        df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet, skiprows=5)
        if not df.empty:
            sheet_data[sheet] = df.head()
    return sheet_data

# Read Excel files and check for additional sheets containing data
excel_files = [
    "statistic_id952763_costco_-paid-membership-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx",
    "statistic_id718406_costco_-memberships-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx"
]

excel_previews = {}
for file in excel_files:
    file_path = f'/mnt/data/{file}'
    excel_previews[file] = read_excel_sheets(file_path)

# We have found some numerical data in the Excel files:

- statistic_id952763_costco_-paid-membership-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx: This file contains the number of paid Costco members worldwide from 2014 to 2019. The data starts from 42 million in 2014 and goes up to 53.9 million in 2019.

- statistic_id718406_costco_-memberships-worldwide-2014-2022.xlsx: This file contains the number of Costco card holders worldwide from 2014 to 2019. The data starts from 76.4 million in 2014 and goes up to 98.5 million in 2019.

- lafayette_parish_population_2023.csv: This dataset contains population data for areas in Lafayette Parish for the year 2023.

# *We used the Membership Growth Prediction: We will predict the future growth of Costco memberships globally*

# Predicting membership growth can provide valuable insights for business strategy and planning. 
 ##To build a predictive model for global membership growth, I'll consider the following steps:

- Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify trends and patterns.
- Model Building: Use machine learning techniques to build the predictive model.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance.
- Prediction: Use the model to make future predictions.
  
## Let's start with the Data Preparation step. I'll combine the data from the two relevant Excel filesâ€” one containing the number of paid Costco members worldwide and the other containing the total number of Costco card holders worldwide. This will give us a more comprehensive view of membership growth


## It appears that the columns are not properly labeled, likely due to the way the Excel sheets were read. I'll clean up these datasets by appropriately renaming the columns and dropping any unnecessary ones. Then, we can proceed with the data merging and analysis.

# Now we have a cleaned and merged dataset that contains the following information:

- Year: The year of the data
- Paid_Memberships_Millions: The number of paid Costco memberships worldwide, in millions
- Total_Memberships_Millions: The total number of Costco card holders worldwide, in millions

## With this dataset in hand, we can proceed to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) step. Here, we'll visualize the data to identify trends and patterns that can inform our predictive model.

## *The line plots above showcase the growth trends for both paid and total memberships at Costco from 2015 to 2022:*

- Growth of Paid Memberships Worldwide: There is a steady upward trend in the number of paid memberships. The growth seems to be fairly consistent over the years.

- Growth of Total Memberships Worldwide: Similarly, the total memberships also show a steady upward trend. The growth pattern is quite consistent, similar to that of paid memberships.

- These trends suggest that a linear or polynomial model might be a good fit for making future predictions.

# Next, we'll move on to Model Building. I'll start by preparing the data for training and testing, and then proceed to fit a model to it.



# I started with a simple linear regression model for its interpretability and ease of use. If the linear model performs reasonably well, it may serve our purpose. If not, we can explore more complex models like polynomial regression or even time series models.

- Data Preparation: Separate the features (Year) and labels (Paid_Memberships_Millions and Total_Memberships_Millions).
- Train the Model: Fit a linear regression model to the data.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).


# Let's start with Data Preparation.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# Prepare the features and labels for Paid Memberships
X = membership_data[['Year']]
y_paid = membership_data['Paid_Memberships_Millions']
y_total = membership_data['Total_Memberships_Millions']

# Train a linear regression model for Paid Memberships
model_paid = LinearRegression()
model_paid.fit(X, y_paid)

# Train a linear regression model for Total Memberships
model_total = LinearRegression()
model_total.fit(X, y_total)

# Make predictions
y_paid_pred = model_paid.predict(X)
y_total_pred = model_total.predict(X)

# Calculate evaluation metrics
mse_paid = mean_squared_error(y_paid, y_paid_pred)
r2_paid = r2_score(y_paid, y_paid_pred)

mse_total = mean_squared_error(y_total, y_total_pred)
r2_total = r2_score(y_total, y_total_pred)

mse_paid, r2_paid, mse_total, r2_total



# The evaluation metrics for the linear regression models are as follows:

**For Paid Memberships:**
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 
0.9372
0.9372
R-squared (
ï¿½
2
R 
2): 0.9798 
0.9798

**For Total Memberships:**
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 
2.1632
2.1632
R-squared (ï¿½2R 2):0.98500.9850
Both models have high ï¿½2R 2
  values, which indicates a good fit to the observed data. The MSE values are also relatively low, suggesting that the model makes predictions that are close to the actual values.



# Create subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6))

# Plot for Paid Memberships with Predictions
sns.scatterplot(x='Year', y='Paid_Memberships_Millions', data=membership_data, ax=axes[0], label='Actual', color='blue')
sns.lineplot(x=membership_data['Year'], y=y_paid_pred, ax=axes[0], label='Predicted', color='red')
axes[0].set_title('Paid Memberships: Actual vs Predicted', fontsize=14)
axes[0].set_xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)
axes[0].set_ylabel('Paid Memberships (Millions)', fontsize=12)
axes[0].legend()

# Plot for Total Memberships with Predictions
sns.scatterplot(x='Year', y='Total_Memberships_Millions', data=membership_data, ax=axes[1], label='Actual', color='blue')
sns.lineplot(x=membership_data['Year'], y=y_total_pred, ax=axes[1], label='Predicted', color='red')
axes[1].set_title('Total Memberships: Actual vs Predicted', fontsize=14)
axes[1].set_xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)
axes[1].set_ylabel('Total Memberships (Millions)', fontsize=12)

# The plots above compare the actual data points (in blue) with the predictions made by the linear regression models (in red) for both paid and total memberships.

- Paid Memberships: Actual vs Predicted: The red line closely follows the actual data points, indicating a good fit for the model.

- Total Memberships: Actual vs Predicted: Similarly, the model for total memberships also shows a good fit, with the red line closely following the actual data points.

*These visualizations confirm that the linear models are reasonably accurate for predicting future membership growth.*


#  Now that we have validated models, we can use them to make future predictions for both paid and total memberships at Costco for the next few years.

**Let's forecast the membership numbers for the years 2023 to 2033.**

**I'll use the trained models to predict the memberships for these years.**


# Create an array for the future years
future_years = np.array(range(2023, 2034)).reshape(-1, 1)

# Use the trained models to make predictions for future years
future_paid_memberships = model_paid.predict(future_years)
future_total_memberships = model_total.predict(future_years)

# Create a DataFrame to store the future predictions
future_predictions = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': future_years.flatten(),
    'Predicted_Paid_Memberships_Millions': future_paid_memberships,
    'Predicted_Total_Memberships_Millions': future_total_memberships
})

future_predictions


# According to these predictions:

- The number of Paid Memberships is expected to grow from approximately 67.34 million in 2023 to around 96.78 million by 2033.

- The Total Memberships are expected to increase from approximately 121.83 million in 2023 to around 173.91 million by 2033.


 
 # Now we can visualize these predictions

 # Create subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6))

# Plot for Predicted Paid Memberships
sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Predicted_Paid_Memberships_Millions', data=future_predictions, ax=axes[0], marker='o', color='green')
axes[0].set_title('Predicted Growth of Paid Memberships Worldwide (2023-2033)', fontsize=14)
axes[0].set_xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)
axes[0].set_ylabel('Predicted Paid Memberships (Millions)', fontsize=12)

# Plot for Predicted Total Memberships
sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Predicted_Total_Memberships_Millions', data=future_predictions, ax=axes[1], marker='o', color='purple')
axes[1].set_title('Predicted Growth of Total Memberships Worldwide (2023-2033)', fontsize=14)
axes[1].set_xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)
axes[1].set_ylabel('Predicted Total Memberships (Millions)', fontsize=12)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


## Here are the visualizations for the predicted growth of Costco memberships worldwide from 2023 to 2033:

- **Predicted Growth of Paid Memberships Worldwide (2023-2033): The green line indicates a steady growth in paid memberships, increasing from about 67 million in 2023 to approximately 97 million by 2033.**

- **Predicted Growth of Total Memberships Worldwide (2023-2033): The purple line also suggests a steady growth in total memberships, increasing from about 122 million in 2023 to around 174 million by 2033.**

**These predictions can be valuable for Costco's long-term planning and strategic decision-making.**
